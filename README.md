### Description:
A 2D shooter game where the player shoots at an alien to score points. Each successful hit increases the alien's speed, making the game progressively harder. Missing the target ends the game. The goal is to achieve the highest score by consistently hitting the alien.

This game demonstrates my knowledge of Functions/Methods and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is developed in Lua, a language similar to Python but better suited for game development due to its simplicity and robust support for graphics and OOP.

The source code is organized into the following files, located in the "SourceCode" folder:

1. **main.lua** - Handles main game logic, keyboard inputs, and background rendering.
2. **player.lua** - Defines player behaviors and animations.
3. **enemy.lua** - Defines the enemy logic, including movement.
4. **bullet.lua** - Handles the player's shooting mechanics.
